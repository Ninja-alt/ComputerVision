# ComputerVision:
Image classification using CNNs in Keras
Plant Seedlings Recognition

Context:
Differentiate a weed from a crop seedling? The ability to do so effectively can mean better crop yields and better stewardship of the environment. The Aarhus University Signal Processing group, in collaboration with University of Southern Denmark, has recently released a dataset containing images of unique plants belonging to 12 species at several growth stages.

Steps:
Pre-processing of image data.
Visualization of images.
Building CNN.
Evaluate the Model.
The motive of the project is to make the learners capable to handle images/image classification problems, during this process you should also be capable to handle real image files, not just limited to a numpy array of image pixels.
